# Blackjack

## Description
This project is a simple web-based card game developed using JavaScript and Express.js. The game's backend logic runs on an Express server, while the frontend provides an interactive interface for the user to play the game. The game involves creating a deck of cards, shuffling them, and dealing them to a player and a computer opponent. It includes features like adding top cards to the deck based on user input, shuffling the deck, dealing cards, calculating hand totals, and allowing the player to hit or stand. The game's outcome is determined based on the total value of the hands, adhering to the basic rules of blackjack where the goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the opponent's without exceeding it.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Frontend JavaScript dynamically updates the game's UI to reflect the current state of the game, including the hands dealt, totals, and game outcomes.
- **Import/Export Functionality:** Conceptual feature for importing/exporting game states or deck configurations using CSV files (backend functionality indicated but not fully implemented in the provided code).
